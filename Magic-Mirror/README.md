# Magic Mirror Project
Utilized API’s to pull data from online services and incorporated various open source github modules to 
construct a personalized screen. Personalized screen displayed weather, google calendar, time and more. 
Connected a PIR sensor to make proximity detection work (turns on/off to save power).
